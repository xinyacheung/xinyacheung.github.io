<div class="textLayer"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation"><br role="presentation" />Link weight variation offers superiority in controlling temporal networks 2022<br role="presentation" />Oral presentation at International Conference NetSci 2022. We found that degree-heterogeneous networks are more advantageous for enhancing controllability, and the favorable positions of weight variation are the incoming links of the nodes with a high outdegree and a low indegree, as well as the topological position of the perturbed link plays a crucial role in such an effect. The control cost increases approximately exponentially with the distance from the driver node to the perturbed link.</span></div>

<div class="textLayer"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Structural origin of co-susceptibility in cascading failures 2018<br role="presentation" />Oral presentation at International Conference NetSci-X 2018. We found that both structural closeness and high-order correlations could lead to co-susceptibility. This finding prompted us to propose a new statistical quantity, based on structure only, to assess the co-susceptibility of node pairs in an arbitrary network.</span></div>

<div class="textLayer"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">&bull; Neural similarity<br role="presentation" />We aim to model monkey brain learning on a flexible visuomotor decision-making task with a deep neural network architecture. The level of complexity of a visuomotor decision-making task, first discriminating cues and then classifying color or motion tasks accordingly, allowed us to investigate whether the monkey brain and the neural network we developed reflect attentional effects like dimensional stretching as the empirical facts of attentional stretching in other animals.<br role="presentation" />&bull; Hidden patterns in real networks<br role="presentation" />We are analyzing the dataset of neuron-level network of Drosophila central brain, aiming to reveal its hidden patterns and the relationship between structure and function. We found that the smallest spanning tree of brain network is very interesting, i.e. each branch on this tree happens to be in the same community. Next, we will explore the functional regions&rsquo; distribution of neurons within same community.<br role="presentation" />&bull; Data-driven control of nonlinear network systems<br role="presentation" />While most previous work of network control focused on linearized systems that represent local dynamics around a basin, real network systems exhibit multiple basins or attractors. Hence it is of importance to find the strategy to steer the network system from one basin to any desired basin. In this project we are developing a deep learning framework for controlling nonlinear systems. The method is model-free, i.e. based on the observation of nodal activities only.<br role="presentation" />&bull; Structural Coarse-graining on Graph Using Slow-timescale Features of Markov Process<br role="presentation" />We develop a competitive tool of structural coarse-graining to unfold a graph on multiple scales that can be used for further studies on the multi-scale emergence of complex networks. We utilize the slow features of a class of Markov processes such as random walks, for which the apparent (short-term) behaviour is jumping between single nodes whereas the long-term behaviour, governed by the slow-timescale features, is moving between clusters</span></div>
