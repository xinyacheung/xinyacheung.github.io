I am currently a PhD candidate at Tongji University, Shanghai, P. R. China, working with Prof. Gang Yan on complex systems and network science. I started my academic career in physics, with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Physics from Tongji University. Outside of network science, phisical based machine learning and neuroscience, I like learning anything new, enjoy travelling, photography and talking nonsense in English.
