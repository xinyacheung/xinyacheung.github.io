<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>The control of temporal networks is of paramount importance to complex systems in diverse fields. Recent studies showed that temporal networks are more controllable than their static counterparts, in terms of control time, cost, and trajectory length. However, the underlying mechanism of this intriguing phenomenon remains elusive, partly due to the fact that multiple properties of a temporal network simultaneously change over time. Here, we explore a general model of temporal networks, and prove that the weight variation of a link is equivalent to attaching a virtual driver node to that link. Consequently, the random variation of link weights can significantly increase the dimension of controllable space and remarkably reduce control cost, which unveils the fundamental mechanism for the advantages of temporal networks in controllability. The finding of this mechanism leads to a graphic criterion that allows us to further discover that, degree-heterogeneous networks are more advantageous for enhancing controllability by link weight variation, and the favorable positions of weight variation are the incoming links of the nodes with a high outdegree and a low indegree. Our results are validated in both synthetic and empirical network data, together deepening the understanding of network temporality and shedding light on the long-standing problem of establishing graphic criteria for the controllability of general dynamic systems.</p>

<strong>Inferring Patient Zero on Temporal Networks via Graph Neural Networks</a></strong>, <i>AAAI</i>, 2022<br>with Xiaolei Ru, Jack Murdoch Moore, yeting zeng and Gang Yan<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>The world is currently seeing frequent local outbreaks of epidemics, such as COVID-19 and Monkeypox. Preventing further propagation of the outbreak requires prompt implementation of control measures, and a critical step is to quickly infer patient zero. This backtracking task is challenging for two reasons. First, due to the sudden emergence of local epidemics, information recording the spreading process is limited. Second, the spreading process has strong randomness. To address these challenges, we tailor a gnn-based model to establish the inverse statistical association between the current and initial state implicitly. This model uses contact topology and the current state of the local population to determine the possibility that each individual could be patient zero. We benchmark our model on data from important epidemiological models on five real temporal networks, showing performance significantly superior to previous methods. We also demonstrate that our method is robust to missing information about contact structure or current state. Further, we find the individuals assigned higher inferred possibility by model are closer to patient zero in terms of core number and the activity sequence recording the times at which the individual had contact with other nodes.</p>

<strong>Attentive Transfer Entropy to Exploit Transient Emergence of Coupling Effect</strong><br>with Xiaolei Ru, Jack Murdoch Moore, Zijia Liu and Gang Yan<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Causal reasoning mechanisms injected into a machine learning model can improve explainability and generalization by revealing the process underlying observed data. Here, we present progress in this research direction. We consider the problem of reconstructing causal networks based on time series data generated by complex nonlinear dynamics with self-drive and weak coupling. It is a challenging task, particularly in neural activity sequences where causal effects emerge only momentarily but otherwise remain dormant. To meet the challenge, we propose the mechanism of causal attention, which guides a machine learning model to make inference focusing on the special areas of time series data where causality may manifest. Attention is directed using causal attention coefficients assigned throughout the considered time series by a neural network trained to maximise an information measure, the Attention-extended Transfer Entropy, which represents a novel generalisation of the iconic Transfer Entropy. Our results show that, without any prior knowledge of dynamics, causal attention explicitly identifies areas where the coupling force is significant. This innovation substantially improves reconstruction performance for both synthetic and real causal networks using data generated by neuronal models widely used in computational neuroscience.</p><br>

<strong>Structural Coarse-graining on Graphs Using Slow-timescale Features of Markov Processes</strong><br>with Xiaolei Ru, Jack Murdoch Moore, Yeting Zeng and Gang Yan<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>We develop a competitive tool of structural coarse-graining to unfold a graph on multiple scales that can be used for further studies on the multi-scale emergence of complex networks. We utilize the slow features of a class of Markov processes such as random walks, for which the apparent (short-term) behavior is jumping between single nodes whereas the long-term behavior, governed by the slow-timescale features, is moving between clusters. Specifically, the features are learned by maximizing mutual information between two observations separated by a given time-span, and coarse-grained structures are identified by clustering the nodes in feature space. The coarse-grained structure becomes more macroscopic with the increase of time-span. Experiments on a scientific collaboration network show that hierarchical community structures emerge clearly as time scale is varied. Experiments with the human connectome demonstrate that our method provides an alternative to geometric renormalization to predict the multi-scale invariance of self-similarity.</p><br>
