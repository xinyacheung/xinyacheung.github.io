<strong>Xin-Ya Zhang (张昕亚)</strong><br>
Postdoctoral fellow, Westlake University

I got my PhD in physics at Tongji University, specializing in <strong>complex systems</strong> for scientific discovery. My research focuses on exploring the structure, dynamics, and control theory in complex networks. I utilize a combination of physical methodologies and machine learning algorithms to <u>unveil simple laws or mechanisms in complex systems</u> , particularly in brain. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Applied Physics from Tongji University, where I began my academic journey.

Throughout my academic career, I have focused on <strong>cognitive neuroscience</strong> and <strong>AI</strong>, trained at University College London. Specifically, <u>attentional stretching of neural representations</u> was found in monkeys across various task contexts. This stretching phenomenon occurs even within functionally bounded regions, contrasting with that observed in ANNs. Additionally, utilizing the same dataset, I have provided compelling evidence for brain-computer interfaces, especially in <u>vision decoding and encoding</u>. These projects are not only intriguing but also offer fresh insights into the workings of the brain and artificial intelligence, potentially advancing the development of brain-inspired AI models.

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Westlake University, continue to explore the intersection of <strong>complex systems</strong> and <strong>AI</strong>. I expect that what I have learned can help explain phenomena in AI computational systems and be applied to AI, which may differ fundamentally from the brain and other systems, yet may also harbor simple laws.

Outside of my academic work, I enjoy learning new things, traveling, photography, and talking nonsense in English.

<strong>Some words have inspired me. I hope they inspire you too:</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Do I need ..?"</p>

  <p>"Definitely no. Only you're alive and have passion. That's enough."</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid you try you will learn something."</p>

  <p>"Don't need to be perfect, just be yourself, finding your peace and fulfillment."</p>
