I am currently a PhD candidate at Tongji University, Shanghai, P. R. China, working with Prof. Gang Yan on complex systems and network science, and from October 2022, I am a visiting researcher in Love Lab at University College London for a year, working with Prof. Bradley C. Love on cognitive and decision science.  I started my academic career in physics, with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Physics from Tongji University. Outside of network science and physical methodologies, I like learning about Maxwellâ€™s demon, innovations in machine learning, enjoy travelling, photography and talking nonsense in English.
