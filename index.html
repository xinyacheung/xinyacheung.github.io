Welcome! My name is Xin-Ya Zhang (Xinya Zhang) and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Theoretical Physics at Tongji University. From October 2022 I joined Love Lab at University College London as a visiting researcher for a year.

<br><br>
My research interest centers around complex systems, AI for science, computational neuroscience and taking great videos while traveling. I often use physical methodologies and machine learning techniques into my research to explore hidden structure patterns, dynamic behaviour and control in complex networks especially in brain networks. Feel free to look at my <a href="https://xinyacheung.github.io/research" target="_self">research page</a> to learn more!
