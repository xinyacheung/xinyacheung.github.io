I am currently a PhD candidate on complex systems and AI for science at Tongji University. I started my academic career in physics, with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Physics from Tongji University. 

Throughout my doctoral studies, my focus has been on exploring the structure, dynamics, and control of complex networks. I utilize a combination of physical methodologies and machine learning algorithms to unveil underlying mechanisms, particularly in brain. 

Outside of network science, phisical based machine learning and neuroscience, I like learning anything new, enjoy travelling, photography and talking nonsense in English.
